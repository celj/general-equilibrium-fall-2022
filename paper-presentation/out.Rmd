# Introduction

## General Equilibrium Theory

- Long history and deep mathematical grounding
- We attempt to explain supply, demand, and prices
- Arrow--Debreu Model is **central**

# Setting and Background

---

We consider economies consisting of:

- A set $[\ell] := \{1, \dots, \ell\}$ of **divisible goods**
- A set $[m] := \{1, \dots, m\}$ of **agents embedded as nodes** in some graph $G = ([m], E)$, whose edges $E$ describe who may trade with whom
- A **bundle of goods** $\mathbf{e}^i \in \R^\ell_+$ that agent $i \in [m]$ enters the market with
- A **utility function** $u_i : \R^\ell_+ \to \R_+$ that encodes agent $i$'s preferences over bundles of goods

---

### Graphical Economy
A **graphical economy** is an undirected graph $G$ over agents $[m]$ with neighbor relation $\simeq$, utilities $\{u_i : \R^\ell_+ \to \R_+\}_{i \in [m]}$, and endowments $\{\mathbf{e}^i \in \R^\ell_+\}_{i \in [m]}$, where $\ell$ is an integer denoting the number of goods being traded.

---

For ease of exposition, $G$ is assumed undirected --- all results can be easily extended to directed graphs.

---

To discuss equilibria in a graphical economy, we also need:

- Local price vectors $\mathbf{p}^i \in \R^\ell_+$ for each agent $i \in [m]$
- The bundle of goods $\mathbf{x}^{ij} \in \R^\ell_+$ agent $i$ purchases from agent $j$ for consumption
  - To enforce the condition that trade must traverse edges, $\mathbf{x}^{ij} = 0$ for $j \not\simeq i$

---

Agent $i$ buys an amount $x^{ij}_k$ of good $k$ from agent $j$ for consumption

\begin{gather*}
i \neq j \in [m] \\
k \in [\ell]
\end{gather*}

# The Arrow--Debreu (AD) Exchange Model

---

The graphical economies are generalizations of AD which retain AD as a special case.

### AD Equilibrium

An **AD Equilibrium** is a pair $(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{x})$ of a set of price vectors $\mathbf{p}$ and set of consumption plans $\mathbf{x}$ such that, if the underlying graph is complete, we have $\mathbf{p}^i = \mathbf{p}^j$ for all $i, j \in [m]$, and the following conditions are satisfied:

- *Market Clearing.*

$$
\sum_{i,j \in [m]} \mathbf{x}^{ij} = \sum_{i \in [m]} \mathbf{e}^i
$$

- *Individual Rationality.* For all agents $i \in [m]$, setting $\hat{\mathbf{x}}^i = \mathbf{x}^i$ maximizes their utility $u_i \left( \sum_{j \simeq i} \hat{\mathbf{x}}^{ij} \right)$ over all $\hat{\mathbf{x}}^i \in \R^\ell_+$ satisfying

$$
\sum_{j \simeq i} \mathbf{p}^j \cdot \hat{\mathbf{x}}^{ij} \leq \mathbf{p}^i \cdot \mathbf{e}^i
$$

---

- Agents sell endowments at market prices
- They spend profits on goods maximizing their utility
- There is a single global market
  - Single price for each good
  - Every pair of agents can trade
  - Markets are cleared when the demand of all agents is equal to the supply of all agents
